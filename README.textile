Very simple rack app for serving HAML/SCSS pages as semi-static sites.

Pages are served out of @views/DOMAIN/@, based on the domain of the request.

To run locally:

<pre><code>
$ grep localhost /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1	localhost myevacplan.local railsantipatterns.local
</code></pre>

...and use bundler:  @bundle && bundle exec shotgun@
